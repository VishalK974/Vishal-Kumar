        "### The awards committee of your Prepleaf asked for your assistance with a budget allocation problem they're facing. Originally, the committee planned to give N research grants this year. However, due to spending cutbacks, the budget was reduced to newBudget and now they need to reallocate the grants. The committee made a decision that they'd like to impact as few grant recipients as possible by applying a maximum cap on all grants. Every grant initially planned to be higher than cap will now be exactly cap. Grants less or equal to cap, obviously, won't be impacted.\n",
